description: "This deck examines whether (and how) websites are blocked and
    tries to detect censorship and/or surveillance systems in your network. The
    Web Connectivity test examines whether access to websites is blocked through
    DNS tampering, TCP/IP blocking, or by a transparent HTTP proxy. This deck
    uses a list of all entries from the official blocking list in Cyprus
    (located in http://blocking.nba.com.cy)"
